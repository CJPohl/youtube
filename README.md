# Youtube Downloader for Mac

## Purpose

Youtube, the popular video streaming website is well known for prohibiting the
user from downloading videos.  There are many uses for downloading these videos
as either video or audio files as there are many third-party websites that
exist online that allow a user to do just that on-demand.  However, these
website are often ridden with pop-up ads, malware, and worse!

The Youtube Downloader program exists as a user-friendly command line program
to download an audio or video file from a user's URL link of choice to their mac
downloads folder.

## Features

- Custom file path to user's download folder
- Input URL of choice to be downloaded
- Selection between an audio file (m4a) or a video file (mp4)
- Option to create a custom name for the file

## Reflection

Working on this program was a healthy introduction to the art of troubleshooting.
Understanding how to navigate system errors and read through module documentation
allowed the successful implementation of this project.  While the problem solving
nature of the program has been successful, I strive to continue to allow my
programs and applications be understandable and accessible by the masses.
